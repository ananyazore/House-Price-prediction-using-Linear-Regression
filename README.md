# House-Price-prediction-using-Linear-Regression
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict house prices based on key factors such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and total square footage. Using Linear Regression, the model identifies patterns in the data to estimate property values accurately.

The dataset undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values and inconsistencies before exploratory data analysis is conducted to understand feature relationships. Visualizations are used to examine correlations and distributions, providing insights into the impact of each variable on house prices.

The model is implemented using Python with Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for training, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization. It is evaluated using metrics like the RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error to assess its predictive performance.
